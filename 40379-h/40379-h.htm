<p>Trench Ballads <br />and Other Verses</p>
<p>By <br />Erwin Clarkson Garrett <br />Author of “Army Ballads and Other Verses”</p>
<p>PHILADELPHIA <br />THE JOHN C. WINSTON COMPANY <br />1919</p>
<p>Copyright, 1919, <br />by The John C. Winston Co.</p>
<p>THIS BOOK IS DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY OF <br />MY FATHER, <br />the late Captain George L. Garrett, of the Union <br />Army, during the Civil War <br />AND TO <br />MY MOTHER, <br />whose lifelong devotion, unselfishness, tenderness <br />and loyalty to me, as to all her family and <br />friends, make this dedication a pleasure <br />and a joy only commensurate <br />with my thought of her.</p>
<h2 id="preface">PREFACE</h2>
<p>I have divided this book into three distinct parts. Part I, Trench Ballads, consists of forty American soldier poems of America’s participation in the World War, 1917-19, based entirely on actual facts and incidents, and almost exclusively on my own personal experiences and observations, when a private in Company G, 16th Infantry, First Division, of the American Expeditionary Forces in France. Part II, Pre-war Poems, consists of three sets of verses written just before the active entry of America in the war, and appertaining to, but not an integral part of, it, and therefore grouped separately. Part III, Other Poems, contains those of a general and non-military character.</p>
<p>It is highly desirable the “Notes” at the end of this volume should be consulted, and that it be realized that with few exceptions, all these Trench Ballads were written in France, many scribbled on odd pieces of paper or on old envelopes in the trenches themselves, and consequently, when present locality is intimated, it is always France, that is to say, from the standpoint that I am speaking in and from the seat of operations. For example, when I use the term “over here,” it really means what the people at home in America would call “over there.” Hyperbole or little characteristic anecdotes that really never occurred, except in the brain of an author, I have absolutely shunned, and have endeavored to adhere strictly to “the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth,” and to set forth the vicissitudes; the dangers, joys and tribulations of the army man, and especially the man in the ranks, and more especially the man in the ranks of the Infantry, as these latter formed the actual front-line or combat troops that bore the brunt in this greatest of all wars.</p>
<p>Absolute continuity or sequence would seem superfluous, but it will be observed that I have endeavored to maintain it to a certain extent, i.e., by gradually leading from a number of military verses, without any strict inter-relation, to the day of being wounded, then on to several poems concerning the military hospital, and finally bringing the Trench Ballads to a close with those having to do with the returning home of the soldier.</p>
<p>My previous book, “Army Ballads and Other Verses,” is the result of my experiences when serving as a private in Companies “L” and “G,” 23rd Infantry and Troop “I,” 5th Cavalry (Regulars), during the Philippine Insurrection of 1899-1902, and if “Army Ballads and Other Verses” is taken in conjunction with this volume, it is my hope together they may prove a fairly comprehensive anthology of the American soldier of recent times.</p>

<p><em>You chose no easy Service, <br />    No safe job, friends of mine, <br />But the mud of the shell-torn, trenches <br />    And the foremost battle-line. <br />No camouflage patriotism— <br />    Though you had from a wealth to choose <br />But the wicked work of No Man’s Land, <br />    Filling a man’s-size shoes.</em></p>
<p><em>You didn’t say you wouldn’t play <br />    If you got no shoulder bars— <br />You even placed your Country <br />    Above a general’s stars: <br />For shocking, very shocking, <br />    You didn’t give a damn <br />About your “social status,” <br />    When you fought for Uncle Sam.</em></p>
<p><em>Friends of mine, friends of mine, <br />    I’ve shared your toil and tears— <br />Your dangers and your little woes, <br />    When days were turned to years. <br />I may not make them understand <br />    The things that you have done, <br />But God bless you and God keep you— <br />    Every blessed mother’s son.</em></p>
<h2 id="part-i.-trench-ballads.">PART I. TRENCH BALLADS.</h2>
<h3 id="trenches.">TRENCHES.</h3>
<p>Trenches dripping, wet and cold— <br />    Trenches hot and dry— <br />Long, drab, endless trenches <br />    Stretching far and nigh.</p>
<p>Zigzag, fretted, running sere <br />    From the cold North Sea, <br />’Cross the muddy Flanders plain <br />    And vales of Picardy.</p>
<p>Through the fields of new, green wheat <br />    Filled with poppies red, <br />While abandoned plow-shares show <br />    Whence the peasants fled.</p>
<p>Past the great cathedral towns, <br />    Where each gorgeous spire <br />Torn and tottering, slowly wilts <br />    ‘Neath the Vandals’ ire.</p>
<p>Hiding in the shadows <br />    Of the hills of French Lorraine, <br />And bending south through rugged heights <br />    To the land of sun again.</p>
<p>Trenches, endless trenches, <br />    Shod with high desire— <br />All that man holds more than life, <br />    And touched with patriot fire.</p>
<p>Trenches, endless trenches, <br />    Where tightening draws the cord <br />’Round the throat of brutal Kultur, <br />    And its red and dripping sword.</p>
<p>Trenches, endless trenches, <br />    Bleached and choked with rain, <br />Could ye speak what tales ye’d tell <br />    Of honor, death and pain.</p>
<p>Could ye speak, what tales ye’d tell <br />    Of shame and golden worth, <br />To the glory and damnation <br />    Of the spawn of all the Earth.</p>
<h3 id="barb-wire-posts.">BARB-WIRE POSTS.</h3>
<p>Five o ’clock; the shadows fall <br />    In mist and gloom and cloud; <br />And No Man’s Land is a sullen waste, <br />    Wrapped in a sodden shroud; <br />And the click of Big Mac’s moving foot <br />    Is a dangerous noise and loud.</p>
<p>Ten o’clock; the wind moans low— <br />    Each tree is a phantom gray: <br />And the wired posts are silent ghosts <br />    That move with a drunken sway; <br />(But never a gleam in No Man’s Land <br />    Till the dawn of another day).</p>
<p>Twelve o ‘clock; the heavens yawn <br />    Like the mouth of a chasm deep; <br />And see—that isn’t the fence out there— <br />    It’s a Boche—and he stoops to creep— <br />I’ll take a shot—oh hell, a post— <br />    (Oh God, for a wink o’ sleep).</p>
<p>Two o ’clock; the cold wet fog <br />    Bears down in dripping banks: <br />Ah, here they come—the dirty hounds— <br />    In swinging, serried ranks! <br />Why don’t the automatics start? . . . <br />    Or do my eyes play pranks?</p>
<p>It doesn’t seem a column now, <br />    But just two sneaking there: <br />And one is climbing over, <br />    While the other of the pair <br />Is clipping at the wires <br />    With exasperating care.</p>
<p>(I’m sober as a gray-beard judge <br />    I’m calm as the morning dew— <br />I’m wide awake and I’ll stake <br />    My eyes with the best of you; <br />But I can’t explain just how or why <br />    Posts do the things they do.)</p>
<p>Three o’clock; they’re on the move— <br />    Well, let the beggars come. . . . <br />A crash — a hush — a spiral shriek— <br />    And a noise like a big bass drum— <br />(I hope that Hun shot hasn’t found <br />    Our kitchen and the slum).</p>
<p>.    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .</p>
<p>Five o’clock; the first faint streak <br />    Of a leaden dawn lifts gray; <br />And the barb-wire posts are sightless ghosts <br />    That swagger, click and sway, <br />And seem to grin, in their blood-stained sin, <br />    In a most unpleasant way.</p>
<h3 id="feet.">FEET.</h3>
<p>Some say this war was fought and won <br />    With gleaming bayonets, <br />That lift and laugh with Death’s own chaff <br />    And leave no fond regrets: <br />Some, by the long lean foul-lipped guns <br />    Where the first barrages meet, <br />But I, by the poor old weary limping <br />    Tired broken feet.</p>
<p>Some say this war was fought and won <br />    By the crawling, reeking gas; <br />Some, by the flitting birdmen, <br />    That dip and pause and pass: <br />Some, by the splitting hand-grenades— <br />    But I, I hear the beat <br />Of the poor old faithful worn limping <br />    Tired broken feet.</p>
<p>Some say the war was fought and won <br />    By This or That or Those— <br />But I, by heel and sunken arch <br />    And blistered, bleeding toes. <br />Drag on, drag on, oh weary miles, <br />    Through mire, slush and sleet, <br />To the glory of the rhythm <br />    Of the poor old broken feet.</p>
<h3 id="your-gas-mask.">YOUR GAS-MASK.</h3>
<p>When over your shoulders your “full-field” you fling, <br />And you curse the whole load for a horrible thing, <br />What is it you reach for, as outward you swing? <br />        Your gas-mask.</p>
<p>If you head for a bath by the small river’s flow— <br />Though only a distance of fifty or so— <br />What is it you carefully grab ere you go? <br />       Your gas-mask.</p>
<p>When in full marching-order, where mules <em>might</em> suffice, <br />And you count your equipment, each having its price, <br />What is it you feel for and count over twice? <br />       Your gas-mask.</p>
<p>In morning and afternoon, evening and night— <br />In first or support lines, in sleep or in fight, <br />What is it you cherish and cling to so tight? <br />       Your gas-mask.</p>
<p>What is it you never leave thoughtless behind? <br />What is it you clutch for with fingers that bind <br />As you sniff that first odor that comes on the wind? <br />       Your gas-mask.</p>
<h3 id="slum-and-beef-stew.">SLUM AND BEEF STEW.</h3>
<p>It’s a lot of dirty water <br />    And some little dabs of spuds, <br />And dubious hunks of gristly meat <br />    And divers other duds.</p>
<p>Served up to us in trenches, <br />    Our hunger made it good, <br />But elsewhere—when we got it— <br />    &quot;We ate it, if we could.</p>
<p>And now about the time Josephus <br />    Tells his gobs to call <br />Port and Starboard, left and right, <br />    We’re ordered, one and all,</p>
<p>To most respectfully address <br />    Our slum as “beef stew”—Gosh, <br />Methinks the Brains of the Army <br />    Has dished-up awful bosh.</p>
<p>For slum is slum, and your Tummy-tum <br />    Has called it so for aye; <br />As ‘twas when Thotmes III marched north <br />    To check the Hittites’ sway.</p>
<p>As ‘twas when Cyrus’ doughboys swept <br />    Through the Cilician Gates— <br />And as ’twill ever be so long <br />    As a weary mess-line waits.</p>
<p>So long as Nations fight and eat— <br />    Though all don’t feed as well— <br />For the Colonel is Sitting on the World— <br />    While we are S. O. L.</p>
<p>Perhaps, kind friend, our logic may <br />    Strike you as on the bum— <br />But as we’re Pershing’s slum-hounds, <br />    We’ll call the damn thing “slum”.</p>
<h3 id="shell-fire.">SHELL-FIRE.</h3>
<p><em>The Hun he taught us Gas and things— <br />    But the high explosive shell <br />Was born of the Devil’s mirth <br />    And the reddest forge in Hell.</em></p>
<p>Now one hits the village church, <br />    And the ancient, wavering wall <br />And the little pointed tower swing <br />    And stagger and sway and fall.</p>
<p>Now one hits a red-slag roof, <br />    And eighty feet on high <br />Towers a monstrous, salmon cloud <br />    Against an azure sky.</p>
<p>Now one hits in a field of wheat, <br />    Fresh planted, fair and green, <br />And a mighty, thundering crater bursts <br />    Where abandoned plows careen.</p>
<p>Now one nears with spiral shriek <br />    And strikes in the long white road, <br />And the Lord ha’ mercy on the Red Cross truck, <br />    And its helpless, weary load.</p>
<p>Now one comes where you crouching wait <br />    In the trench’s far-flung line, <br />And you know there is never shelter against <br />    The voice of that deadly whine.</p>
<p>Now one pierces the dugout’s roof, <br />    And when the foul smokes pass, <br />What once was there a dozen men <br />    Is a crimson, clotted mass.</p>
<p>In the pale moonlight or the black of night— <br />    When the sunset fires flare— <br />In the noontime’s calm, without alarm, <br />    The Great Arch Fiend is there, <br />With his frightful cry as he rushes nigh <br />    On his errand of despair.</p>
<h3 id="mr.-fly.">MR. FLY.</h3>
<p>There’s a nice stiff breeze ablowing, <br />        Mr. Fly; <br />That keeps from out my trench. <br />The decomposing stench <br />Of a soldier, Boche or French, <br />        Mr. Fly.</p>
<p>So please run off and play, <br />        Mr. Fly. <br />So please run off and play <br />Like a good fly, right away, <br />For I want to sleep today, <br />        Mr. Fly.</p>
<p>I’m dozing like a bull-finch, <br />        Mr. Fly, <br />When you hop me, unaware, <br />And I wake and swat and swear, <br />And you return with thoughtful care, <br />        Mr. Fly.</p>
<p>Can’t you see I’m <em>very</em> tired, <br />        Mr. Fly? <br />That the G. I. Cans don’t bust, <br />And I’ve nibbled on a crust, <br />And deserve a snooze, I trust, <br />        Mr. Fly.</p>
<p>Do you think it’s square and decent, <br />        Mr. Fly, <br />When the Cooties cease to bite, <br />(And there is no sleep at night) <br />That you give me no respite, <br />        Mr. Fly?</p>
<p>An hour’s calm is with us, <br />        Mr. Fly; <br />And the endless battle strain, <br />And the shelling and the rain, <br />Ought to make it very plain, <br />        Mr. Fly—</p>
<p>That I need a little nap, <br />        Mr. Fly. <br />That I do need mighty well <br />Just to sun and rest a spell, <br />And to sleep here where I fell, <br />        Mr. Fly.</p>
<p>So have a heart, oh have a heart! <br />        Mr. Fly. <br />If you’re looking for a fight <br />And you <em>must</em> come ’round and bite, <br />Make your visit in the night, <br />        Mr. Fly.</p>
<h3 id="the-salvation-army-with-the-a.-e.-f.">THE SALVATION ARMY WITH THE A. E. F.</h3>
<p>You kept no roped-off rows of chairs <br />    Or clubs “For Officers Only,” <br />But you toiled for John Doe when he was <br />    Cold, tired, wet and lonely.</p>
<p>You didn’t squander millions <br />    On soldiers warming benches, <br />But you worked like blazes for the ones <br />    That frequented the trenches.</p>
<p>You didn’t stick to cast-iron rules <br />    Of business most punctilious, <br />And you never treated Private Doe <br />    With manner supercilious.</p>
<p>You had no boundless backing— <br />    But just inside your doors <br />It seemed like, “Feel to home, Bill— <br />    Sit down, the place is yours.”</p>
<p>Some things we fain remember— <br />    Some things we fain forget— <br />But you, oh kindly people, <br />    Live in our memory yet.</p>
<h3 id="shell-holes.">SHELL-HOLES.</h3>
<p>They’re ugly, jagged, cone-shaped holes <br />    That litter up the ground, <br />That ruin all the landscape <br />    For miles and miles around.</p>
<p>That pock-mark fertile fields of green— <br />    That rip the hard French roads, <br />And catch the lumbering trucks at night <br />    Agroan beneath their loads.</p>
<p>And some of them are little uns <br />    The shrill one-pounders plow— <br />About a meter—edge to edge— <br />    But large enough, I trow.</p>
<p>And some of them nigh twice as broad, <br />    And rather more straight down, <br />The “77” Boches’ gift, <br />    Of dubious renown.</p>
<p>And some of them a dozen feet <br />    From rim to ragged rim, <br />And deep enough to hide a horse— <br />    A crater, gaunt and grim.</p>
<p>And some of them are yellow-black, <br />    Where clings the reek of gas, <br />(But here we do not pause to gaze, <br />    Nor linger as we pass).</p>
<p>And some of them are water-fouled— <br />    Or dried and parched and dun; <br />And some of them are newly turned— <br />    Fresh blotches ’neath the sun.</p>
<p>But all spell red destruction, <br />    Blind rage and blinding hate, <br />To them who charge the shell-swept zone <br />    Or in the trenches wait.</p>
<p>Should we say “all,” or modify <br />    Our statement? Any fool <br />Knows that exceptions always rise <br />    To prove an iron-clad rule.</p>
<p>And so in this case we can name <br />    <em>Some</em> shell-holes we have met, <br />The thought of whose engulfing sides <br />    Clings in our memory yet.</p>
<p>They were the holes we rolled into— <br />    When iron or bullet struck— <br />Cursing the cursed Prussian, <br />    And blessing our blesséd luck.</p>
<p>Oh lovely, beauteous shell-hole, <br />    Wherein we helpless lay, <br />A wondrous couch of velvet <br />    Ye seemed to us that day.</p>
<p>Our blood it stained your cushions <br />    A deep and richer red, <br />As shrieking messengers of death <br />    Sped harmless overhead.</p>
<p>Swept whining in their blood-lust, <br />    Hell’s music, bleak and grim, <br />Splitting in rage the edges <br />    Of your all-protecting rim.</p>
<p>Oh shell-holes, murderous shell-holes, <br />    In vales of grass and wheat— <br />On hillside and in forest, <br />    In road and village street—</p>
<p>Your toll of suffering and death <br />    Is flashed to East and West— <br />But tell they of the wounded <br />    Ye’ve sheltered in your breast?</p>
<h3 id="food.">FOOD.</h3>
<p>We’ve eaten at the Plaza, at Sherry’s and the Ritz— <br />The Bellevue and the Willard and the Ponce de Leon<br />    too. <br />We’ve sampled all the cooking of the Savoy and <br />    Meurice, <br />Through a palate-tickling riot that Lucullus never <br />    knew.</p>
<p>From tables where the Northern Fires greet the <br />    coming night— <br />To Raffles out in Singapore and the Palace in Bombay; <br />From Shepheard’s (which means Cairo) to that little <br />    hostelry <br />Way down in Trinchinopoly where purring punkahs <br />    sway.</p>
<p>We’ve traveled north, we’ve traveled south by all <br />    routes known to man— <br />We’ve traveled east, we ’ve traveled west by some they <br />    scarcely came: <br />From canvasback and terrapin to Russian caviar, <br />From venison to bird-nest soup and curried things <br />    and game.</p>
<p>We’ve put them all beneath our belt with consummate <br />    address: <br />We’ve risen from the laden board and smacked our <br />    jowl in glee. <br />With organs sound and healthy we have murdered <br />    each menu <br />And left the wreck of good things with a gourmet’s <br />    ecstasy.</p>
<p>But do you wish to know the feasts that permeated <br />    deep— <br />That stirred the very bottom of my stomach to the <br />    core? <br />Quisine that brought such wondrous bliss, but satiated <br />    not, That saturating satisfied, but still left room for more?</p>
<p>The place—a little half deserted town in northern <br />    France: <br />The time—a time of carnage, of wanton strife and <br />    hate: <br />And I and my battalion on reserve a week or two <br />Till they call us to the Front again to force the hands <br />    of Fate.</p>
<p>Just from the Commissary, the Salvation or the Y, <br />I’ve got a bar of chocolate, some butter and some cake; <br />A canteen full of milk, and eggs, from the old <br />    farmhouse near by, <br />And with this <em>tout ensemble</em> you can see I’m sitting <br />    jake.</p>
<p>I’ve entered now a peasant’s house—an ancient, <br />    kindly dame— <br />Who’s seen me several times before, and knows just <br />    what I wish: <br />So the frying-pan is gotten out—the pewter fork and <br />    knife— A big bowl and the skillet and a large, substantial <br />    dish.</p>
<p>And I’m breaking up the bar of chocolate in a mighty <br />    bowl <br />(The while the eggs are frying, “Sur le plat, oui, s’il <br />    vous plait”), <br />And pouring from my canteen’s gurgling mouth a <br />    draught of milk, <br />To expedite proceedings in a purely tactful way.</p>
<p>And now the spluttering eggs are done, the chocolate’s <br />    hot and rich; <br />I have my feet beneath the board, the pewter weapons <br />    near: <br />A hunger from a front-line trench—the stomach of a <br />    goat— <br />And a battle-line that’s very far, though still the guns <br />    ring clear.</p>
<p>And thus, too full for utterance, I gently draw the <br />    veil— <br />So leave me, kindly reader, in my joy— <br />And maybe you will understand why other dinners <br />    pale, <br />And in comparison with this, appear to clog and cloy.</p>
<h3 id="over-the-top.">OVER THE TOP.</h3>
<p>We’ve soldiered many, many moons <br />    In this old plugging war, <br />And all the ills and all the thrills, <br />    We’ve had ’em o’er and o’er.</p>
<p>Shell-fire, G. I. Cans and Gas— <br />    Night work in No Man’s Land— <br />And everything that calls for nerve, <br />    Endurance, guts and sand.</p>
<p>We’ve argued which we liked the <em>worst</em>— <br />    Machine-guns, gas or shell. <br />We’ve ruminated carefully— <br />    And done it rather well.</p>
<p>And after all our resumé <br />    And cogitating bull, <br />We’ve reached a clear decision, <br />    Most amplified and full:—</p>
<p>The greatest time in all the life <br />    Of any living man— <br />The mightiest moment of the Game— <br />    The proudest, high élan;</p>
<p>The thing we came three thousand miles <br />    Across the seas to do— <br />“The Day,” the splendid hour <br />    That waits for me and you,</p>
<p>Arrives—We spring into the wastes <br />    Of land, ripped, roweled and barred— <br />The battle-lust in brain and eye— <br />    The weary jaw set hard;</p>
<p>The rifle gripped in hands of steel, <br />    Where, flashing in the sun, <br />Sweep on our blazing bayonets, <br />    The terror of the Hun.</p>
<h3 id="the-battle-mother.">THE BATTLE MOTHER.</h3>
<p>Over the sodden trenches— <br />    Over the skirmish line— <br />High o’er the hole-torn fields and roads <br />    Cometh a face to mine.</p>
<p>Under the burning gas attack, <br />    And the stench of the bursting shell, <br />We hope we may live for her dear sake— <br />    She who would wish us well.</p>
<p>(She who has ever cherished us— <br />    But when the hour came <br />Choked back the tears of the faithful years, <br />    As we left to play the game.)</p>
<p>Between the blazing horizons <br />    That hammer the long night through, <br />Lapping their tongues of hatred— <br />    Fearless she comes to you.</p>
<p>And over the roar of battle <br />    Where the shrill-voiced shrapnel sings, <br />Shine forth the loving eyes we hold <br />    Above all earthly things.</p>
<p><em>A World run mad with slaughter— <br />    A charnel-house of blood— <br />But the face of the Battle Mother <br />    Above the crimson flood.</em></p>

<p><em>The drafted men fought hard and well, <br />    The whole big army did, <br />But we prefer the spirit <br />    Of the Bayard and the Cid.</em></p>
<p>The drafted men fought hard and well, <br />    But when Jack sailed for France, <br />They didn’t have to drag us in <br />    By the back of our neck and the seat of our pants.</p>
<p>The drafted men fought hard and well, <br />    But when it first began, <br />From coast to coast, from Lakes to Gulf, <br />    We rose, a single man.</p>
<p>The drafted men fought hard and well, <br />    But when the days were black, <br />Glad we sprang to the call to front <br />    The snarling, charging pack.</p>
<p>The red-fanged, savage hounds of hate, <br />    In a victor’s drunken might: <br />The unleashed, howling gray hordes <br />    Sweeping plain and height.</p>
<p>The drafted men fought hard and well, <br />    But when the great floes pressed, <br />Came we to break the ice and clear <br />    A channel for the rest.</p>
<p>The drafted men fought hard and well, <br />    But now the thing is o’er, <br />We ’re glad we came the way we came <br />    When the Nation rose to war.</p>
<p>The drafted men fought hard and well, <br />    But now the thing is done, <br />We’re glad we came the time we came <br />    In the heyday of the Hun.</p>
<p>Shades of Patrick Henry— <br />    Of Washington and Hale, <br />God grant we’ve kept the trust—God grant <br />    The Old Guard shall not fail.</p>

<h3 id="o.-d.">O. D.</h3>
<p><em>O. D., it</em> ought <em>to mean Oh Damn,</em> <br />    <em>When in the pay of Uncle Sam:</em> <br /><em>But when you hear the soldier blab</em> <br />    <em>“O. D.,” it just means Olive Drab.</em></p>
<p>The leggings, breeches and the boots <br />    Of Uncle Samuel’s war galoots— <br />The overcoats and jackets too, <br />    Confess the selfsame mournful hue.</p>
<p>It may be excellent camouflage <br />    To try to fool a young barrage; <br />It may not show the bally dirt <br />    So much upon your knees and shirt.</p>
<p>It may be serviceable and such <br />    When you are beating-up the “Dutch;” <br />But from a calm esthetic point, <br />    The color’s sadly out-of-joint.</p>
<p>A little mud on red or blue <br />    May seem quite prominent to you; <br />But put the same upon O. D., <br />    And the whole blame thing looks mud to me.</p>
<p>But then, it matches trenches well, <br />    And things that make you say, Oh Hell <br />For instance, hikes, inspections, drills, <br />    And busted arms with C. C. pills.</p>
<p>It makes you heave a sigh or two <br />    For the good old days of brass and blue; <br />But if it’s fit to beat the “Dutch” <br />    I guess it doesn’t matter much.</p>

<p>They’re shooting shrapnel o’er the trench— <br />        My boy. <br />They’re shooting shrapnel o’er the trench, <br />Which means tonight they’ll surely drench <br />These works with shells that burst and stench <br />        (And cloy).</p>
<p>They’re shooting shrapnel o’er the trench— <br />        My lad. <br />It breaks with shrill and tinny sound, <br />And quite promiscuously around <br />It showers metal on the ground <br />        (It’s bad).</p>
<p>They’re shooting shrapnel o’er the trench— <br />        Recruit. <br />So do not stand and stupid stare <br />Till some comes down and parts your hair, <br />But hunt your dugout and beware <br />        (To boot).</p>
<p>They’re shooting shrapnel o’er the trench— <br />        Young man. <br />Which means tonight the gas shells’ thud <br />Will muffled fall like chunks of mud; <br />And th’ blinding, crashing Prince of Blood— <br />        The G. I. Can.</p>

<p>We haven’t been in this large strife <br />    So very long to date, <br />But we have learned our answer to <br />    The Prussian “Hymn of Hate.” <br />And we are feeding him for pap, <br />    As plain as A. B. C, <br />A pretty little ditty known <br />    As “Reciprocity.”</p>
<p>The Hun he planned for War, red War, <br />    By ocean, air and land; <br />And he is getting oodles of <br />    The same, to date, in hand. <br />He suddenly sprang poison gas <br />    Upon a valiant foe, <br />And now he’s getting gas and gas, <br />    And more gas, as you know.</p>
<p>He found new tricks and wrinkles for <br />    This gory battle game, <br />And now we stoop, no more his dupe, <br />    And beat him at the same. <br />He drowned our women in the sea— <br />    He ravished where he won— <br />But these were little things we couldn’t <br />    Copy from the Hun.</p>
<p>His crimson heel lie bade us feel, <br />    His lust and pride and scorn— <br />Till, echoing in our weary breasts <br />    A righteous hate was born. . . . . <br />Beware the patient man in wrath, <br />    The olden proverb saith; <br />And, Spawn of a Kultur nursed in blood— <br />    In blood meet ye your death.</p>

<p>We’re bowling over the roads of France— <br />                White roads. <br />We’re twenty gray tracks in a long, long line, <br />Twisting and rumbling and feeling fine. <br />And some day we’ll roll to the Watch on the Rhine— <br />                Joyous loads.</p>
<p>But now we’re returning to billets for rest— <br />                Earned repose. <br />We’ve been in the trenches for many a week. <br />In rain and in wind and in dugouts that leak. <br />Till we all are so hoarse we scarcely can speak. <br />                Goodness knows.</p>
<p>Our clothes they are worn and tattered and torn, <br />                And mud? <br />My heavens! we have it in our leggings and hair— <br />On breeches and jackets and all that we wear— <br />But we are so happy, we really don’t care— <br />                ’Tisn’t blood.</p>
<p>It isn’t those long, endless vigils at night, <br />                On the rack. <br />It isn’t the fighting and hunger and heat— <br />It isn’t the slush and rheumatics and sleet— <br />It isn’t the once-a-day cold meal we eat <br />                In the black.</p>
<p>It isn’t the shelling from sun unto sun— <br />                Curséd shells: <br />It isn’t the camouflage that you must use <br />If you have to lie down in your trench for a snooze, <br />It isn’t the stenches the Hun corpses choose <br />                For their smells.</p>
<p>But it’s clean clothes and gasoline-bath and a shave— <br />                What a treat! <br />It’s sleeping on elegant straw, and undressed, <br />With never a Toto disturbing your rest; <br />It’s regaining your “pep” and a wonderful zest <br />                When you eat.</p>
<p>We’re all of us willing, we’re all of us game <br />                For the fray: <br />But now we have finished a good hitch, and more, <br />In conducting this large and salubrious war, <br />Do you think we should feel very tearful or sore <br />                On this day?</p>
<p>So some we are singing and some shoot the bull, <br />                And some sleep. <br />(Don’t wake the poor devil, just leave him alone, <br />Though he’s jammed on your foot till it’s dead as a <br />    stone), <br />And we rumble through towns on the way to our own, <br />                Packed like sheep.</p>
<p>And your hand is afingering bills large and small— <br />                Francs galore. <br />And you’ve visions of things that your poor stomach begs, <br />Including nuts, candy and chocolate and eggs; <br />And you find you’ve forgotten the crick in your legs— <br />                Cramped and sore.</p>
<p>We’re a light-hearted, dirty-faced, rollicking crew— <br />                Grimy pawed: <br />Though a few cogitate on the living and dead, <br />And some look behindward, and some look ahead, <br />And some think of bunkies that shrapnel has sped <br />                To their God.</p>

<p>Oh Mademoiselle you sure are “chic” <br />    From your head to the tip o’ your toes, <br />And if you like us, you just plain <em>like</em> us, <br />    And you don’t give a damn who knows.</p>
<p>And Mademoiselle those eyes, Oo la la! <br />    So sparkling, dark and rare, <br />With the love of all the ages lying <br />    Deep and dormant there.</p>
<p>(Please, please don’t think us fickle— <br />    That we didn’t play the game— <br />But you seemed so human and made to be loved, <br />    And we murmured, “Je vous aime.”)</p>

<p>American Expeditionary Forces, 1917-1919.</p>
<p>When the clarion call of Country <br />    Bade strong men rise and go, <br />Came they the first of the willing first, <br />    In the pride that leal men know.</p>
<p>When the Eagle soared and its broad wings spread <br />    ’Bove the shores of an angered land, <br />Sailed they the first of the Viking first <br />    Where the treacherous waters spanned.</p>
<p>When the Eagle’s Brood awoke to the shriek <br />    Of the great shells day and night, <br />First of the flock bled they beneath <br />    The star-flare’s blinding light.</p>
<p>When the lunging, torn front lines locked <br />    And the strife raged man and man, <br />Swept they the first of the fighting first— <br />    And the van of the battle van.</p>
<p>.    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .</p>
<p>From the training days of Gondrecourt— <br />    Demange—cold, wet and gray— <br />To the trenches north of Lunéville— <br />    To Bouconville—Xivray—</p>
<p>To the crater-pitted, wasted tracts <br />    Of war-torn Picardy, <br />And the ghastly rubble hilltop <br />    Where Cantigny used to be:</p>
<p>To the splendid days of Soissons— <br />    The crisis of the strife: <br />To where giant pincers severed <br />    St. Mihiel as a knife:</p>
<p>To the glorious, stubborn struggle <br />    Up the rugged Argonne slopes, <br />Till the gates of Sedan crumbled <br />    With the Vandals’ crumbling hopes.</p>
<p>.    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .</p>
<p>Sweeping in conquering columns <br />    To the banks of the vaunted Rhine— <br />Ever the first of the fighting first, <br />    And the Lords of the Battle Line.</p>

<p>Little gold chevrons on my cuffs, <br />    What is the tale ye tell? <br />“We to the left, of the long months spent <br />Where the somber seasons slowly blent— <br />And I to the right, of the ragged rent <br />    That took so long to get well.”</p>

<h3 id="the-favorite-song.">THE FAVORITE SONG.</h3>
<p>(“There’s a long, long Trail.”)</p>
<p>They sing a song that the pines of Maine <br />    Hear in the winter’s blast— <br />They sing a song that the riders hum, <br />    Where the cattle plains spread vast; <br />But there is one they love the most— <br />    And they keep it for the last.</p>
<p>They sing the lays of Puget Sound <br />    Aglimmering in the sun— <br />Of the cotton fields of Alabam’, <br />    Where the Gulf-bound rivers run, <br />But one they sing with a wistful look, <br />    When all the rest are done.</p>
<p>They chant of the land of Dixie, <br />    And their “Little Gray Home in the West”— <br />Of how they’ll “can the Kaiser”— <br />    And they roar with bellowing zest; <br />But one they sing as it were a prayer— <br />    The song they love the best.</p>
<p>From Xivray to Cantigny— <br />    From Soissons to the Meuse — <br />From the Argonne wilds to the white-clad Vosges <br />    Agleam in the dawn’s first hues— <br />They sing a sacred song, for it <br />    Is red with battle-dews.</p>
<p>For it is sanctified by space— <br />    And the cruel wheel of Time; <br />And sacrifice has hallowed it, <br />    And mellowed every rhyme, <br />Until it wells from weary throats <br />    A thing men call sublime.</p>
<p>In frozen trench and billet— <br />    In mire, muck and rain— <br />Where the roar of unleashed batteries <br />    Hurl forth their fires again; <br />At rest, or back in Blighty, <br />    Torn with shell and pain—</p>
<p>There’s a song they dub the fairest— <br />    There’s a lilt they love the best— <br />“There’s a long, long trail awinding” <br />    To the haven of their quest, <br />Where the tip of the rainbow reaches <br />    A land in the golden west.</p>
<h3 id="captain-blankburg.">CAPTAIN BLANKBURG.</h3>
<p>“When Greek meets Greek.”</p>
<h4 id="i">I</h4>
<p>They knew he was a German— <br />    They thought he was a spy— <br /><em>Toujours</em> they “covered” him and said, <br />    “We’ll catch him by-and-by.”</p>
<p>They tried to find, by word or act, <br />    In front-line trench or rear, <br />Some circumstance that would betray <br />    His treacherous dealings clear.</p>
<p>They scanned his face when hostile flares <br />    Set No Man’s Land alight— <br />They watched him when the Hun barrage <br />    Tore craters left and right.</p>
<p>They noted every move he made, <br />    With ever wakeful eye, <br />Reiterating o’er and o’er, <br />    “We’ll catch him by-and-by.”</p>
<h4 id="ii">II</h4>
<p>At last the opportunity <br />    Loomed large in fact and view, <br />And every near-sleuth in the bunch <br />    Saw that his hunch was true.</p>
<p>Because, upon an inky night, <br />    When mist hung o’er the nation, <br />The captain took a picked patrol <br />    To gather information.</p>
<p>And as they crept on hands and knees, <br />    In Land No Man may own, <br />Their stomachs struck the dew-wet grass <br />    With never sound or moan.</p>
<p>(The reason being that the Boche, <br />    On selfsame errand set, <br />Were creeping hitherward unseen— <br />    And likewise mad and wet.)</p>
<p>’Twas then the detail turned their heads <br />    To where their captain lay, <br />And every rifle in that squad <br />    Was pointed straight his way.</p>
<p>And he? He running true to form, <br />    Two inches raised his chin, <br />And spouted German volubly <br />    In accents clear and thin.</p>
<p>Click, click, click, click, click, down the line <br />    Each safety-catch turned o’er, <br />But the captain did not hesitate, <br />    And merely talked the more.</p>
<p>In conversation friendly <br />    He rambled gently on <br />Unto the Boches’ leader, <br />    Till it was nearly dawn.</p>
<p>The while his men they “covered” him— <br />    The while their hearts grew black— <br />And you could feel the trigger fingers <br />    Squeezing up the slack.</p>
<p>Just what the purport of his last <br />    Remark was, no one knew, <br />But in a burst of confidence <br />    A Boche head rose in view. . . .</p>
<p>Across the four-fold stillness <br />    That covers No Man’s Land, <br />An automatic pistol shot <br />    Rang clear and piercing and</p>
<p>The next day German papers told <br />    How Captain Skunk von Skee <br />Was killed by a Yankee captain, <br />    And Yankee treachery.</p>
<h3 id="little-war-mothers.">LITTLE WAR MOTHERS.</h3>
<p>When you look at his picture and your eyes <br />    Are dimmed and mighty wet, <br />And it seems as though your trembling hands <br />    Could reach and touch him yet: <br />When you faintly call and he answers not <br />    Your supplicating prayer, <br />Remember his last thought was You: <br />    I know—for I was there.</p>
<p>When the day is done and the hearth-fire glows, <br />    And you slowly knit and knit; <br />And your furtive eyes from the embers rise <br />    To where he used to sit: <br />And you feel he never can slip up <br />    And kiss you unaware, <br />Remember his last word was You: <br />    I know—for I was there.</p>
<p>When your dear brave heart is breaking— <br />    And life is ’reft of joy; <br />And only the spark of memory— <br />    The face of a boy—your boy: <br />May the good God hover over you, <br />    And touch your silvered hair, <br />And tell you what I’ve tried to tell: <br />    He knows — for He was there.</p>
<h3 id="interrupted-chow.">INTERRUPTED CHOW.</h3>
<p>I’ve had some mighty narrow calls— <br />    Some close shaves not a few, <br />But one of the fairly closest <br />    I’ll now narrate to you.</p>
<p>’Twas midnight—hush! the plot grows thick— <br />    Crowd close, and hold your breath— <br />’Twas midnight—and the slum-cart came <br />    Upon its round of death.</p>
<p>(It isn’t really that the slum <br />    Was quite as bad as that, <br />But the playful Boche so often dropped <br />    A shell where it was at.)</p>
<p>’Twas midnight—and our appetites <br />    Were whetted large and keen, <br />As trench feed, once a day, must leave <br />    An interval between.</p>
<p>And so we sought the buzzy-cart, <br />    “Mess-kits alert” and found <br />It standing in a quiet spot <br />    Where never came a sound—</p>
<p>Excepting that of bursting shells <br />    Across the field a way, <br />(But as I said before, the Boche <br />    Is very given to play).</p>
<p>All innocent and hungry-like <br />    And empty to the core, <br />I came upon that buzzy-cart, <br />    With never thought of war.</p>
<p>More calm, beneficent and mild— <br />    More free from things of strife— <br />I promise you I never was <br />    In all my mortal life.</p>
<p>The air was fair, the stars were out, <br />    The mocking-bird sang clear; <br />The poppies bloomed, the sergeants fumed, <br />    And food was very near.</p>
<p>When suddenly the ground gave way— <br />    It seemed a mile or more— <br />And the whole adjacent landscape leapt <br />    To heaven with a soar.</p>
<p>Earth, rocks and stars commingling <br />    In a swirling mass arose, <br />Where I, recumbent in the hole, <br />    Assumed an easy pose.</p>
<p>And when I found that I was there— <br />    Both arms, both legs, and head, <br />I picked me up and cogitated <br />    <em>Why</em> I wasn’t dead.</p>
<p>For information looked I ’round <br />    North, south and east and west— <br />But the good platoon had up and cleared <br />    Some several feet with zest.</p>
<p>(And the strangest phase of the whole strange thing, <br />    For me to understand, <br />Was that when I got up I had <br />    My mess-kit in my hand.)</p>
<p>And there I stood and gazed me down <br />    Upon the hole and mud, <br />And found I was alive because <br />    That blamed shell was a “dud.”</p>
<p>A dud’s a shell that fails to burst— <br />    Whose crater’s microscopic— <br />And as I’d just sunk down in it, <br />    My Fates were philanthropic—</p>
<p>For had the bally thing gone off— <br />    Instead of sitting jake— <br />You’d ne’er have found my scattered parts <br />    With a hair-comb or a rake.</p>
<p>You’d ne’er have found your humble slave— <br />    For, sprinkled east and west, <br />My sad remains would scarce have bulged <br />    The pocket of your vest.</p>
<p>A finger in Benares— <br />    A toe in Timbuctoo— <br />And on the Mountains of the Moon <br />    A portion of my shoe.</p>
<p>An eye on Kinchinjanga— <br />    To greet the snow-peaked morn; <br />An ear at Cape Lopatka, <br />    And my dog-tag at the Horn.</p>

<h3 id="the-gas-proof-mule.">THE GAS-PROOF MULE.</h3>
<p>I’ve heard the cat hath nine lives, <br />    The hen and worm I’ve seen, <br />But a genuine, long eared, gas-proof mule <br />    Is the toughest thing they wean.</p>
<p>Each night he hauled the water-cart— <br />    (And to know what Water means, <br />You have to see a trench-bound bunch <br />    When filling their canteens).</p>
<p>However, no digression now, <br />    But straightway to my story, <br />And I’ll paint that black mule white <br />    And crowned with a crown of glory.</p>
<p>We crowded ’round the faucets— <br />    On each, six waited turns— <br />The thirstiest crew I ever knew— <br />    With the ingrowing thirst that burns.</p>
<p>And all was peace and quiet— <br />    The pause before the storm— <br />When the distant, whirling, demon shriek <br />    Of the G. I. Cans took form.</p>
<p>And when the third one got our range, <br />    With haste, but dignity, <br />We sought the dugouts ’cross the road, <br />    Calm, though precipitously.</p>
<p>But the fastest thing I’ve seen on legs, <br />    And I’ve seen the best, at that. <br />Was the water-mule when he took the road <br />    At a hundred in nothing flat.</p>
<p>Whether he headed for gay Paree— <br />    For Brussels or Berlin— <br />We didn’t stop to figure out— <br />    But he sure was headed in.</p>
<p>We only thought of our thirst next day, <br />    And a song we’d heard afar, <br />Of the farm recruit who bade good-bye <br />    To his “mule with the old hee-haw.”</p>
<p>Well, all that night they threw us gas <br />    And high explosive shells, <br />And four long hours we wore our masks, <br />    To ward the murderous smells.</p>
<p>And when the first white streak of dawn <br />    Told “Stand-to” was begun, <br />We stumbled back and took our posts <br />    To wait our friend the Hun.</p>
<p>The Hun did not appear, but gas <br />    Thick clothed both hill and dale <br />In clouds and sheets of dead-man’s drab, <br />    And down in the deepest vale—</p>
<p>With perfect poise and nonchalance, <br />    Sang-froid and savoir-faire, <br />Browsed that fool mule, capaciously, <br />    With never thought or care.</p>
<h3 id="infantry-of-the-world-war.">INFANTRY OF THE WORLD WAR.</h3>
<p>They shall tell of the Arms resplendent— <br />    The men who dared the air; <br />They shall tell of the work of the mighty guns <br />    Where the far horizons flare: <br />They shall tell the tale of the Centaurs— <br />    Each rear and flanking drive— <br />And the song of the Service of Supply, <br />    That kept them all alive.</p>
<p>And when they seem to have finished, <br />    And ye think that the chant is done, <br />They will tell the tale of the tramping men <br />    In the sweat of a torrid sun. <br />They will tell the tale of the marching men <br />    Who plod the live-long night, <br />To reach the crest at the break o’ dawn <br />    When the Nations go to fight.</p>
<p>They will tell the tale of the tired men <br />    Beneath a straining load; <br />Mile by mile with lunging step <br />    And glassy stare on the road. <br />They will tell the tale of the front-line trench, <br />    And the one cold meal at night, <br />And the terrible song of the bursting shells, <br />    And the flares’ uncanny light.</p>
<p>They will tell the tale of the moving ranks <br />    When the zero hour lifts, <br />And the khaki lines leap forward <br />    In the face of the steel-shod drifts. <br />Where the great shots split asunder, <br />    And clutter hill and plain <br />With the weary bodies of the men <br />    Who may not march again.</p>
<p>And so for a wide World’s wonder, <br />    And the ages yet to be, <br />They will sing in deathless numbers <br />    The song of the Infantry. <br />They will slowly close the volume— <br />    The story fully told, And a tear shall fall on the cover, <br />    Whose letters are flaming gold.</p>
<h3 id="the-flowers-of-france.">THE FLOWERS OF FRANCE.</h3>
<p>The flowers of France are blooming <br />    Upon this bright June day, <br />The flowers of France are fragrant <br />    And smiling swing and sway, <br />(For what is death and carnage <br />    A dozen miles away?)</p>
<p>The flowers of France are blooming <br />    Among the wheat and grass— <br />The scarlet headed poppies <br />    That nod you as you pass, <br />And the blue cornflowers’ brilliant hue, <br />    And the daisies in a mass.</p>
<p>The flowers of France are blooming <br />    And beckoning in the breeze, <br />And laughing in the sunshine, <br />    And bending to the bees, <br />(But the wooden crosses in a row— <br />    Oh what know they of these?)</p>
<p>The flowers of France are blooming <br />    In every rainbow shade, <br />And as a rainbow is an arch <br />    By tears of heaven made, <br />I wonder if the flowers of France <br />    Are the tears that France has paid?</p>
<h3 id="a-first-class-private.">A FIRST-CLASS PRIVATE.</h3>
<p><em>I haven’t a worry or a care—</em> <br />    <em>My mind’s “at ease” and furled:</em> <br /><em>For I’m a First-class Private,</em> <br />    <em>And I’m Sitting on the World.</em></p>
<p>The Loot, before the whole platoon, <br />    He up and called me forth <br />To drill my squad, “Squads east” and “west,” <br />    Not mentioning south and north. <br />To drill my squad, “Squads ’round-about,” <br />    For all the World to see— <br />But I’m a First-class Private and <br />    That’s good enough for me.</p>
<p>The Loot he is a dandy man <br />    And all that kind of thing, <br />And I know he wants to see how I <br />    A corporal’s job could swing: <br />But back here in a “rest town” <br />    It just means dirty work, <br />And <em>I</em> must take the bawling-out <br />    For what the squad may shirk.</p>
<p>’Tis I they’d turn and eye with scorn <br />    If some gun wasn’t clean; <br />’Tis I would play the wet nurse <br />    For a rookie <em>none</em> could wean: <br />And if a pair of frozen shoes <br />    Makes Smith miss reveille, <br />It isn’t Smith or “Sunny France,”<br />    It’s me, yes dammit, me.</p>
<p>So forth I take the Squad to drill, <br />    With ne’er a fault or slip; <br />But a smile is in my glance, forsooth, <br />    And a jest is on my lip, <br />Akidding with each friend o’mine— <br />    And the Loot was never fain <br />To try to make a non-com <br />    Of Private Me again.</p>
<p><em>Oh nothing, oh no nothing</em> <br />    <em>May your resolution shake,</em> <br /><em>When you’re a First-class Private,</em> <br />    <em>And you know you’re Sitting Jake.</em></p>
<h3 id="birds-of-battle.">BIRDS OF BATTLE.</h3>
<p>Keats sings in peerless stanzas <br />    To the lovely Nightingale— <br />And Shelley tells of the Skylark <br />    Above the summer gale— <br />But I to the Birds of Battle <br />    Needs lift my numbers frail.</p>
<p>For far by the out-flung wires, <br />    Where the shell-torn tree stumps stand, <br />And over the barren, hole-strewn tracks <br />    Of the wastes of No Man’s Land, <br />In the morning light and the black of night, <br />    The Birds of Battle stand.</p>
<p>No shrieking shots may quell them— <br />    Nor gloom nor storm nor rain, <br />As out of the crash or stillness <br />    A wondrous, shrill refrain <br />Cuts clear and glad and lithesome <br />    Above the death-strewn plain.</p>
<p>The weary heavens welcome, <br />    And echo back the song, <br />And weary soldiers linger, <br />    And pause to listen long <br />To the one glad cry in a war-torn sky, <br />    That holds so much of wrong.</p>
<h3 id="only-for-you.">ONLY FOR YOU.</h3>
<p>The torturous hike up the hill road, <br />    Plowing through snow and mud; <br />The poor weary arches breaking— <br />    The socks that are wet with our blood: <br />The terrible, binding, burning strap <br />    That’s cutting our shoulder through— <br />And our parched lips stammer, “My Country, <br />    For you and only for you.”</p>
<p>The slight and the slur and the nagging <br />    We must take from a rowdy or cad; <br />And we simply salute and say “Yes sir,” <br />    And pretend that we never feel mad: <br />Though our heart is a forest of hatred— <br />    And justice seems hidden from view— <br />And we mutter, “For you, oh my Country— <br />    For you, yea, and only for you.”</p>
<p>When all evening long the guns’ reddened glares <br />    Turn night into hellish day, <br />Till in Berserker rage their silver bursts cut <br />    The drab of the dawn’s growing gray: <br />When over the top we are starting again— <br />    Full knowing the thing that we do— <br />We murmur, “For you, oh my Country— <br />    For you, aye and only for you.”</p>
<h3 id="cooties.">COOTIES.</h3>
<p>Some people call ’em Totos— <br />    Some people call ’em Lice; <br />Some people call ’em several things <br />    That really aren’t nice; <br />But the Soldier calls ’em “Cooties,” <br />    So “Cooties” must suffice.</p>
<p>We’ve met the dear Mosquito— <br />    We’ve met the festive Fly— <br />It seems to me we’ve seen the Flea <br />    That jumpeth far and high; <br />Yea, we have known various bugs— <br />    Though not the reason why.</p>
<p>But when you’re in the trenches <br />    And cannot take a bath, <br />As one canteen of water <br />    Is all one day one hath, <br />You raise the comely Cooties— <br />    Who raise, in turn, your wrath.</p>
<p>You can’t escape the Cooties <br />    By day nor yet by night. <br />No G. I. Can alarms them, <br />    Nor other sound of fight. <br />Not even Gas affects them— <br />    Which doesn’t seem just right.</p>
<p>You may not eat, you may not sleep, <br />    You may not bat an eye: <br />You may not duck a six-inch shell <br />    That’s singing gaily by, <br />But that a Cootie, like the Poor, <br />    <em>Is with you—very nigh.</em></p>
<p>They bite you singly and in squads, <br />    They have a whole parade; <br />They form a skirmish line and sweep <br />    Across each hill and glade; <br />But seek their dugouts when you think <br />    Your grip is firmly laid.</p>
<p>It does no good to curse ’em— <br />    They cannot hear or talk. <br />It does no good to chase ’em— <br />    To still-hunt or to stalk. <br />The only thing is hand-grenades, <br />    At which, ’tis said, they balk.</p>
<p>Oh Cooties, little Cooties, <br />    You have no sense of shame; <br />You are not fair, you are not square, <br />    You do not play the game— <br />But east and west and south and north <br />    Is spread afar your fame.</p>

<p>I really hate to leave you, <br />        Old Fusee— <br />Where the land is scarred and peeled, <br />And the broken battlefield <br />Bears its red and deadly yield— <br />        Wearily.</p>
<p>I really hate to leave you, <br />        Old Fusee— <br />To the wind and dew and rain <br />Of a shorn and shotted plain, <br />Till stranger hands again <br />        Discover thee.</p>
<p>I really hate to leave you, <br />        Old Fusee— <br />To the clinging, clogging dust— <br />To the all-destroying crust <br />Of a clawing, gnawing rust— <br />        Unmercifully.</p>
<p>I really hate to leave you, <br />        Old Fusee— <br />But they’ve plugged me good and hard, <br />So I quit you, trusty pard, <br />As I creep back rather marred, <br />        To old Blightee.</p>
<p>I really hate to leave you, <br />        Old Fusee— <br />With your bore a brilliant sheen, <br />And your metals black and clean, <br />Where your brown striped stock and lean <br />        Gleams tigerishly.</p>
<p>I really hate to leave you, <br />        Old Fusee— <br />For the wanton weather’s hate, <br />And careless hands to desecrate <br />Barrel, bolt and butt and plate, <br />        Unthinkingly.</p>
<p>I really hate to leave you, <br />        Old Fusee— <br />And I bear a double pain <br />As I pause to turn again <br />Where I left you on the plain, <br />        Unwillingly.</p>

<p>The wounds are dark and red— <br />    All jagged-red in Blighty: <br />And untamed hearts are red <br />Where, stretching bed on bed, <br />Lies lax each weary head, <br />        In Blighty.</p>
<p>The walls are blank and white— <br />    All fresh and white in Blighty: <br />And cheeks are gaunt and white, <br />Where through the endless night <br />They fight the second fight, <br />        In Blighty.</p>
<p>Outside the skies are blue— <br />    Soft, cloud-flecked blue o’er Blighty <br />But clear, relentless blue <br />Of purpose steeled anew <br />Lies there revealed to you <br />        In every eye in Blighty.</p>
<p><em>The shades of red an’ white an’ blue</em> <br /><em>Mean rather more to me an’ you,</em> <br /><em>Than just parades an’ bands an’ such</em> <br /><em>And hollerin’ loud an’ talking much.</em></p>

<p>The stories sure are rich and rare, <br />They’d strike you blind, they’d turn your hair, <br />They’re dark as coal down in the bin— <br />        Till Nurse comes in.</p>
<p>The language is an awful hue, <br />Astreak with crimson shades and blue; <br />’Twould scorch a mammoth’s leather skin— <br />        Till Nurse comes in.</p>
<p>Words run the gamut of the trench— <br />They beat old Mustard Gas for stench, <br />They rise with oscillating din— <br />        Till Nurse comes in.</p>
<p>The cussin’s quaint and loud and strong, <br />Imported stuff, that don’t belong <br />In dictionaries fat or thin— <br />        Till Nurse comes in.</p>
<p>And then you’d be surprised to hear <br />The change of pace, the shift o’ gear, <br />The dainty tales that just begin— <br />        When Nurse comes in.</p>
<h3 id="charlie-chaplin-in-blighty.">CHARLIE CHAPLIN IN BLIGHTY.</h3>
<p>The mess-hall windows blanketed <br />    To bar the western light— <br />The tables cleaned and cleared away, <br />And bench by bench in close array <br />Five hundred convalescents sway <br />    To catch the caption bright.</p>
<p>And there are men with helpless legs, <br />    And torn chest and back; <br />And men with arms in sling and splint, <br />And one poor eye that bears no glint, <br />And muscles limp or turned to flint— <br />    And souls upon the rack.</p>
<p>They came from Chateau Thierry— <br />    From Fere-en-Tardenois— <br />From Soissons, Oulchy-le-Chateau, <br />From Rheims and Fismes, where blow by blow, <br />’Cross Marne and Oureq and Vesle aflow <br />    They hammered them afar.</p>
<p>And now upon the screen is thrown <br />    An old familiar form: <br />’Tis Charlie of the strong appeal, <br />At skating-rink or riot meal, <br />And every mirth-producing reel <br />    Awakes the farthest dorm.</p>
<p>The aching head, the splintered arm, <br />    The weary, dragging feet; <br />The wound that took a month to drain— <br />The everlasting, gnawing pain— <br />Are all forgot and gone again <br />    When Charlie strikes the street.</p>
<p>Your esoteric shrug and sneer <br />    And call him crude and quaint; <br />But we who’ve seen him “over here”— <br />Who’ve heard the laugh that brings the tear— <br />Who’ve heard the bellowing roar and cheer— <br />    <em>We</em> call him Charles the Saint.</p>
<h3 id="two-worlds.">TWO WORLDS.</h3>
<p>Here in the Jardin des Plantes of Nantes <br />    I sit in the nickering shade, <br />Watching the scampering children play— <br />    And the way of a man and a maid— <br />And the noble women of France in the black <br />    Of a Nation unafraid.</p>
<p>The lace of the shadows across the paths <br />    Where the warm sun niters through, <br />And the open vista between the trees, <br />    With the swan pond half in view, <br />And the flowers and sloping lawns and the pines <br />    ’Neath an arch of Brittany’s blue.</p>
<p>The air is soft as a day in June, <br />    The blossoms manifold <br />Throw streaks and patches of rainbow hue <br />    Across the green and gold, <br />And earth and sky in witchery <br />    Entwine you in their hold.</p>
<p>And it comes to me, Can it really be <br />    But two full moons have fled, <br />Since I limped from a scarred and riven field <br />    Where lay the newly dead, <br />Bathed in the light of a splendid fight, <br />    And blotched with their blood’s own red.</p>
<p>A world of crimson slaughter <br />    Where the grim locked legions sway— <br />And the mad machine guns whistle <br />    Their endless roundelay— <br />And the sinister sound of the thundering pound <br />    Of the great guns night and day.</p>
<p>Night and day, night and day, <br />    With scarce a pause between, <br />As out of the empty dark a voice <br />    From the farthest hills unseen, <br />Comes whirling, swirling, shrieking down <br />    Where the helpless front lines lean.</p>
<p>.    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .</p>
<p>The air is soft as a morn in June— <br />    The filmy shadows sway; <br />And only the joyous music <br />    Of the prattle of children at play, <br />And the gentle rustle of whispering leaves <br />    That tell of the closing day.</p>

<p>If you’re a homebound soldier <br />    Who’s done his little best, <br />And you are going ’board the boat <br />    At St. Nazaire or Brest, <br />Bordeaux or any other port, <br />    Steam-up and headed west:</p>
<p>If you are full o’ the joy o’ life <br />    And “pep” and all that stuff; <br />And the ozone permeates your soul <br />    And makes you gay and bluff, <br />Don’t turn and yell, “<em>Who won the War?—</em> <br />    <em>The M Ps</em>,”—Can that guff.</p>
<p>For the M Ps are a sacred caste <br />    That boss the city street <br />A hundred miles behind the Lines <br />    Where dangers never greet, <br />Nor roaming shells come swirling by, <br />    Nor surging first waves meet.</p>
<p>So if the long, tense session <br />    Of soul-engulfing war, <br />And “Prussian” discipline and rule, <br />    And heart-enslaving law <br />Say, “Open wide the throttle <br />    Of lung and throat and jaw”—</p>
<p>Repress that natural impulse, <br />    For you’re not human—yet: <br />Sedately up the gangplank walk, <br />    Eyes front and lips tight set, <br />Or you’ll come back and spend six weeks <br />    In a mud-dump, nice and wet.</p>
<p>The wind is blowing ’cross the bow, <br />    The first smoke lags alee— <br />The sun that’s broken through the clouds <br />    Is dancing on the sea, <br />So, homebound soldier, watch your step, <br />    And take advice from me.</p>

<p>Its contour may not be perfection— <br />    Its technique we really don’t know— <br />If you ever asked, “Who was the artist?” <br />    It would come as a <em>terrible</em> blow. <br />But to us it is home, friends and Country, <br />    To us it means all that is best, <br />’Tis the first that lifts out of the waters <br />    Of “Our little Gray Home in the West.”</p>
<p>’Tis the first on that endless horizon <br />    Where the clouds meet the wind driven spume, <br />And the scavenger gulls wing to greet us <br />    From out of the gathering gloom— <br />’Tis the first that calls beckoning to us <br />    Through the mist of the swaggering sea— <br />“Oh lay down your guns my knight-errant sons, <br />    And come back to the bosom of me.”</p>

<p>The sea that kisses France’s shore, <br />    It beats on yours and mine. <br />Her love and faith and chivalry, <br />    That sparkle as her wine, <br />With all our faith and all our love <br />    Commingling combine.</p>
<p>The colors of the flag of France <br />    Are ours by hue and hue: <br />The blazing red of courage— <br />    The white of purpose true, <br />And constancy and loyalty <br />    Awoven in the blue.</p>
<p>The spirit and the soul of France, <br />    That shatter fetters free, <br />They came to us in darkest days <br />    To weld our destiny; <br />And so with sword in hand we come <br />    To pay our debt to Thee.</p>
<p>To pay our debt a hundredfold— <br />    Friend of our new-born years. <br />To march with you and fight with you, <br />    Till rise the final cheers— <br />And hand in hand, o’er a grave-strewn land,<br />    We blend our mingled tears.</p>
<p>Where blends our blood as once it did <br />    In days of a long gone <br />When the Bourbon lilies leapt and gleamed <br />    Among the Stars on high— <br />And the white and crimson bands of dawn <br />    Rose in the eastern sky.</p>
<p>And the the white and crimson bands of dawn, <br />    And the Stars that glow and glance, <br />Shall girdle them their armor on, <br />    With buckler, sword, and lance, <br />And leap to the charge and sweep the field <br />    With the Trois Couleurs of France,</p>

<p>Well fed, well housed and sleek and smug, <br />    Full pursed and full of pride— <br />Your fields are green, your lanes are fair <br />    Where peaceful homes abide, <br />And your children play by sunny streams <br />    That laughing seaward glide.</p>
<p>What Primal Power tells you eat <br />    To the ends of your belly-greed— <br />What holds your fields with harvests full, <br />    And answers every need— <br />And bids your bairns play laughingly <br />    With never care or heed?</p>
<p>The answer, Fool, is written large <br />    In words of blazing light— <br />They are rewards of dwelling in <br />    A Land of kingly might, <br />That grants you surety and wealth <br />    And guards you, day and night.</p>
<p>And whence, Fool, came its splendid strength— <br />    And why, and how and when? <br />In a World of strife and reddened knife <br />    Did it rise by tongue and pen? <br />No, Dolt, but by the strong right arms, <br />    The arms of its fighting men.</p>
<p>And Ye, Ye would sit with folded hands, <br />    Agaze into Heaven’s blue, <br />With sanctimonious murmurings <br />    Of what the Lord will do; <br />While your neighbor and your neighbor’s son <br />    Go forth and fight for you.</p>
<p>For you, you cur, and your belly-need— <br />    For your hearth and kith and kin: <br />For your harvest and your banking-house <br />    Where you shovel the shekels in, <br />Till the labor has hardened your hands and heart, <br />    And your soul is parchment skin.</p>
<p>Religion cannot cover <br />    A dog whose liver is white. <br />Your Christ, with righteous anger, <br />    Smote hard to left and right <br />The usurers. And never said <br />    He was too proud to fight.</p>
<p>When we are another Belgium <br />    And the land with blood is dyed, <br />And your homes are burned and your women raped, <br />    And ye know that ye have lied— <br />Mayhap ye will say with your final gasp <br />    That ye are satisfied.</p>

<p>I have a sapphire rich and fair <br />    And soft as a velvet sky, <br />When only the stars are shining low <br />And the heavens hold a mystic glow <br />And a hushed world stands agaze to know <br />    The wonderful Whence and Why.</p>
<p>I have a sapphire that I turn <br />    In the dark of somber days: <br />And the darting tongues of nickering blue <br />Flash deep and rare in wondrous hue, <br />Sharp as the lightning, pure as the dew, <br />    And true as m’lady’s gaze.</p>
<p>I have a sapphire that I hold <br />    Beneath the chandelier: <br />And the phosphor of its azure gleam <br />Sweeps clear as the depths of the mountain stream <br />Where the Sun-god hurls his molten beam <br />    In the morn of the golden year.</p>
<p>I have a sapphire I adore— <br />    Of varying whims and moods— <br />Blue-black it lies with never a mark <br />Across the dim unfathomed dark, <br />Till there lifts the glow of a tiny spark— <br />    And again it sullen broods.</p>
<p>I have a sapphire that I bend <br />    ’Neath the light of burning rays: <br />And the flames spread forth a fairy fire, <br />Seething and writhing and leaping higher <br />Till they come to the land of my heart’s desire, <br />    In a glittering, blinding blaze.</p>
<p>I have a sapphire that I hold. <br />    When the goal seems far away: <br />When the lee shore churns in saffron spume. <br />And the fluctuant ocean’s plume on plume <br />Bears down to a rock-ribbed hidden doom, <br />    And the sky is ashen gray.</p>
<p>I have a sapphire that I turn; <br />    And the clouds break, and the wine <br />Of a glorious sun spreads east and west <br />To where the Islands of the Blest <br />Raise verdant shores at my behest, <br />    And a golden world is mine.</p>
<p><em>Oh Sapphire from a distant vale</em> <br />    <em>Where the white Himalayas tower:</em> <br /><em>Where the Kashmir lakes are royal blue,</em> <br /><em>And passions strong and hearts are true,</em> <br /><em>All these are met and blent in you,</em> <br />    <em>A princely heir and dower.</em></p>

<p>Two wee buds o’ Killarney hue <br />    That beckon and beguile— <br />And ’neath your spell we’re learning well <br />    There is something still worth while.</p>

<p>Matchless bard of all the ages— <br />    Lyric sounder of the lyre— <br />Wake among your golden echoes— <br />    Rise amid your latent fire— <br />Tell us, Master of the Muses— <br />    Sweetest singer ever sung— <br />By what law of Earth or Heaven <br />    Ye were called away so young?</p>
<p>By what law of God or Mammon— <br />    By what creed of land or sea— <br />Was a weary World forsaken <br />    Of the mind that harbored thee? <br />Ere that wondrous mind’s fruition <br />    Scarce had grown to the tree.</p>
<p>If the half-fledged sapling gave us <br />    Melodies past human praise— <br />If such virgin buddings crowded <br />    Those few sad and glorious days; <br />If such flowers, barely opened, <br />    Swept us in a wild amaze—</p>
<p>What, Oh Lord and Prince of Poesy, <br />    Would your soul have given to men—<br />What the marvelous meed and measure <br />    Of your pulsing, choral pen— <br />Had your numbered days been lengthened <br />    To a three score years and ten?</p>
<p>As through mystic lands ye led us <br />    O’er the paths your feet had gone: <br />Pipes of Pan—and fain we followed— <br />    Glad and willing slave and pawn, <br />Till we reached the fields Elysian— <br />    Till we faced the gorgeous dawn:</p>
<p>Till the lanes seemed filled with roses— <br />    Roses lipped with opal dew: <br />Till the vales seemed filled with incense— <br />    Incense slowly drifting through: <br />Till the seas seemed filled with grottoes— <br />    Grottoes amber, gold and blue:</p>
<p>Till the songs of birds rang clearer <br />    And the sunshine shone more rare, <br />And the moon above the meadows <br />    Gathered love, and left it there; <br />And the swaying stars rose whiter— <br />    And the World was very fair:</p>
<p>As your thoughts’ eternal fountains, <br />    Shot with iridescent gleams, <br />Floating down through glades enchanted, <br />    On the breast of faery streams, <br />To a pearl-strewn bay of beryl— <br />    Reached the haven of our dreams.</p>

The reason for this appelation being applied to them is simply that when a people have the attributes of a Hun, they must expect to be so designated. A man may very properly be called a pig without any misapprehension that he actually travels upon four hoofs. However, it is possible, though not probable, that the leopard may change his spots; and time, and contact with civilization, and a democratic form of government may eventually eradicate the present very marked idiosyncrasies of the German race.</p>

<dt><strong>The First Division</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Caesar had his Tenth Legion, Napoleon had his Old Guard, and the American Army during the World War had its First Division. It might therefore not seem entirely malapropos to quote the words of the great French general Mangin, who was the corps commander of the First Division of the American Army, the famous First Moroccans of the French Army and the Second Division of the American Army, at the Second Battle of the Marne, that began on July 18th, 1918, and was the turning point of the whole war. In this great door movement the First Division was given practically the post of honor at the <em>hinge</em> itself, i.e., directly at Soissons, only one division, the 153rd French Infantry Division, being on the inside of the First Division, and as it was in this engagement that a gentleman of Teutonic origin, operating a machine-gun from our extreme left flank, and apparently very much irritated about something, put a bullet in my side and out my back, it is only natural that the message of Gen. Mangin was of interest to me, and saved, and here quoted verbatim:—</p>
<p>Lauds Americans in Battle. <br />General Mangin Thanks Pershing’s Men for Brilliant <br />Part in Drive. <br />(By Associated Press.)</p>
<p>With the French. Army in France, Aug. 7.—General Mangin, who was in direct command of the Allied forces in the drive against the German right flank south of Soissons, has issued the following order of the day thanking the American troops for their brilliant participation in the battle which caused the German retreat between the Marne and the Aisne:</p>
<p>&quot;Officers, non-commissioned officers and soldiers of the Third American Army Corps:</p>
<p>&quot;Shoulder to shoulder with your French comrades, you threw yourselves into the counter-offensive begun on July 18th. You ran to it like going to a feast. Your magnificent dash upset and surprised the enemy and your indomitable tenacity stopped counter-attacks by his fresh divisions. You have shown yourselves to be worthy sons of your great country and have gained the admiration of your brothers in arms.</p>
<p>&quot;Ninety-one cannon, 7,200 prisoners, immense booty and ten kilometers (six and a quarter miles) of reconquered territory are your share of the trophies of this victory. Besides this, you have acquired a feeling of your superiority over the barbarian enemy against whom the children of liberty are fighting. To attack him is to vanquish him.</p>
<p>“American comrades, I am grateful to you for the blood you generously spilled on the soil of my country. I am proud of having commanded you during such splendid days, and to have fought with you for the deliverance of the world.”</p>
<p>“The Stars and Stripes,” the weekly paper of the A. E. F. in France, in giving a tabulated form of the record of the various divisions, and their insignia, which was worn on the shoulder of the left sleeve, said the following of the First Division:—</p>
<p>Division Insignia: Crimson figure “1” on khaki background, chosen because the numeral “1” represents the number of the division and many of its subsidiary organizations. Also, as proudly claimed, because it was the “First Division in France; first in sector; first to fire a shot at the Germans; first to attack; first to conduct a raid; first to be raided; first to capture prisoners; first to inflict casualties; first to suffer casualties; first to be cited singly in General Orders; first in the number of Division, Corps and Army Commanders and General Staff Officers produced from its personnel.”</p>
<p>To this might have been added that the First Division, which was a Regular Army division, and originally comprised about twenty or thirty per cent “old soldiers,” and the rest of us “war volunteers,” but proud of being “Regulars,” the First Division, which consisted of the 16th, 18th, 26th and 28th Infantry Regiments, the 5th, 6th and 7th Field Artillery Regiments, the 1st Engineer Regiment, and a complement of Cavalry, etc., was the division that General Pershing, the commander-in-chief, picked out to fill the most vital positions on important occasions, as, for example, when, from the whole army, he chose the First Division to go into the front line just west of Montdidier, at the Battle of Picardy, to help hold the very apex of the huge German bulge that had swept southwestward from St. Quentin to Montdidier, in the great series of Hun drives which started on March 21st. 1918. Again, it was the First Division that Pershing placed at Soissons at virtually the hinge of the great door movement in the turning point of the whole war, the Second Battle of the Marne, as heretofore described; and it was the First Division to which Pershing again gave the post of honor when the St. Mihiel salient was closed, as it was this Division that was placed on the inside position of the great southern jaw, just east of Xivray and dangerous Mont Sec.</p>
<p>Casualties and kilometers make very interesting reading, but when a Commander-in-chief consistently and persistently picks out one certain division for the most difficult and all-important positions, there is not much room for argumentation.</p>
<p>Mr. Page, in his article in <em>The World’s Work</em>, for May. 1919. in describing the Second Battle of the Marne, tells how the First Division went over the top with the 153rd French Infantry Division on its left, and the famous First Moroccan Division and the Second Division of the American Army on its right, and how, in this gruelling engagement, the First Division outlasted both the Second Division and the First Moroccans, and really also the 153rd French Division on its left, as this latter was obliged to get reinforcements, Mr. Page recapitulating the situation with the following paragraph:—</p>
<p>“When the division (the First Division) finally came out of the line it had lost more than 7,200 men, mostly in the infantry. The full complement of infantry in a division is 12.000. Five days’ constant and successful attack after a long march: an advance of more than six and a quarter miles (ten kilometers); losses of at least 50 per cent, of the infantry engaged: keeping pace with the famous Moroccan Division and staving longer in the fight—all this had demonstrated that the 1st Division could stand in any company.” In mentioning these facts there is no desire on my part to pretend that this outfit single-handed won the war, because, if I said that, I would be talking sheer nonsense. The consensus of opinion both at home and abroad, seems to be that the whole American Army lived entirely up to expectations, so that any man who was in a combat division, has good reason to feel proud of his own division, irrespective of what one that may have been. With this little word of explanation I feel at liberty to quote the following which appeared in the Paris edition of The New York Herald:—</p>
<p>Prowess of Yanks Compels Praise Even from Hun, <br />    (Special telegram to the Herald.) <br />        From Burr Price. <br />            With the American Armies. <br />                <em>Friday</em></p>
<p>From a captured officer of the German army comes a remarkable tribute to the fighting prowess of the First Division of the American troops, whose work will go down in history as among the most remarkable of the present war.</p>
<p>He declared the Germans did not believe the Americans could produce, within five years, a division such as they had found the First Division to be. The German, when taken, had seen four years of severe fighting. This is what he had to say yesterday:—</p>
<p>&quot;I received orders to hold the ground at all costs. The American barrage advanced toward my position and the work of your artillery was marvelous. The barrage was so dense that it was impossible for us to move out of our dugouts.</p>
<p>&quot;Following the barrage closely were the troops of the First Division. I saw them forge ahead and knew that all was lost. All night I remained in my dugout, hoping vainly that something would happen that would permit me to rejoin my army. This morning your troops found me and here I am, after four years of fighting, a prisoner.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday, I knew that the First Division was opposite us, and I knew we would have to put up the hardest fight of the war. The First Division is wonderful and the German army knows it.</p>
<p>“We did not believe that within five years the Americans could develop a division such as this First Division. The work of its infantry and artillery is worthy of the best armies of the world.”</p>

All this, of course, was done under cover of darkness, but as the Germans had the range of all the roads, etc., and knew at about what time the food had to be gone after, it meant that almost every night at least one detail was shot to pieces.</p>

<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>While realizing that my personal affairs are of no possible interest to the reader, it would seem, however, almost obligatory for me to do myself justice, and explain that I was quite willing to shoulder responsibility, which this poem might make it appear I was not. Hence the following little anecdote:—During a rest period back from the trenches, which was the only occasion when you had time to bother your head about smaller things, several men had applied for officers’ commissions, so I got some civilian letters of recommendation, and put in an application to be permitted to go up for examination for a commission. This application was forwarded “approved” by my company commander, together with personal recommendations from my three previous company commanders. As this officer is the one who sees you daily, his recommendation is, from a military standpoint, of more value than that of a major-general. But in spite of my application being forwarded with the approval of all four of the company commanders that I had had up to that time, it was disapproved higher up by someone who very seldom could ever have even seen me. But having had no thought or intention of getting a commission, when I entered the Army, and having crossed over to Europe as a civilian, at my own expense, in August, 1917, to enlist in the American Army in France, which I did on September 1st, 1917, in Paris, so as to absolutely insure getting into the trenches, and as at the time of my application I had already accomplished my purpose, it may readily be discerned that the return of my application did not perturb the habitual equanimity of my soul, nor cause me to lose any of my natural sleep or youthful charm.</p>

<dd><p>While very often some junior, or even senior, officer would fall under this category, and even worse, the majority of them really tried to give their men a square deal. If an officer were a rough-neck, snob, or as the men in the ranks would usually express it, a ribbon-counter clerk, it was only quite natural that he would take cowardly advantage of his shoulder straps to make it as miserable as possible for the men under him, but if an officer were a gentleman in civilian life, the man in the ranks was sure to be handled as a man and treated fairly, so long as he did his military duty and conducted himself as a soldier. Of this latter type, I can look back with pleasure on all my company commanders, remembering especially men like Lt. Victor Parks, Jr., and Capt. Allen F. Kingman, “officers and gentlemen” in the highest sense of the word. Upon the one or two officers of the other type it is quite unnecessary to dwell. When once free from contact with a skunk, one simply bathes, changes one’s clothes, and promptly allows the odoriferous memory to be wafted away and disseminated in the ambient atmosphere of oblivion.</p>

<dd><p>Because of its brevity, succinctness and expressiveness, I have used the word Blighty to designate a military hospital, though it was never in really popular use by the American soldier for this purpose, and to the British soldier it simply meant going back to England, but as so often Tommy Atkins went back to his Tight Little Island because he was wounded, Blighty frequently meant “hospital.”</p>
